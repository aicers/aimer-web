# Analysis Result Page

The analysis result page shows a single LLM analysis of one security event.
It is reached from aice-web-next by opening an event detail and following
the deep link to aimer-web, or directly via
`/customers/{customerId}/aice/{aiceId}/events/{eventKey}/analysis`.

## Priority and scores

The header section shows three score-related fields:

- **Priority tier** — one of `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or `LOW`. The
  tier is rendered as a colored badge and is derived deterministically
  from the two scores below via a 4×4 matrix lookup; it is not a value
  returned by the LLM.
- **Severity score** — `0.000`–`1.000`, three decimal places. Answers
  "if this event turned out to be a real attack, how bad would it be"
  (impact, blast radius, asset criticality).
- **Likelihood score** — `0.000`–`1.000`, three decimal places. Answers
  "how likely is this actually malicious rather than noise or a false
  positive" (evidence quality, IoC matches, plausible benign
  explanations).

The two axes are kept separate everywhere so that a high-impact but
uncertain event (`severity≈1.0, likelihood≈0.5`) is not flattened into
the same priority as a confirmed but low-impact event
(`severity≈0.5, likelihood≈1.0`). The matrix translates this pair into
one of the four tiers used for triage and aggregation.

### Tier matrix

|              | L < 0.4 | 0.4 ≤ L < 0.6 | 0.6 ≤ L < 0.8 | L ≥ 0.8  |
|--------------|---------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| S ≥ 0.8      | MEDIUM  | HIGH          | CRITICAL      | CRITICAL |
| 0.6 ≤ S < 0.8 | LOW    | MEDIUM        | HIGH          | HIGH     |
| 0.4 ≤ S < 0.6 | LOW    | LOW           | MEDIUM        | MEDIUM   |
| S < 0.4      | LOW    | LOW           | LOW           | LOW      |

## Score factors

Below each score, the page renders up to five short noun phrases (chips)
the LLM produced to articulate that score. Each axis (severity,
likelihood) has its own row of chips.

- Phrases are LLM-generated, capped at five per axis, with a maximum
  length of ~80 characters each.
- When the LLM did not return any usable phrase for an axis — for
  example, because the input event was too thin to support an
  articulation — the chip row shows a single placeholder reading
  `insufficient evidence`. This sentinel value means "the score is
  recorded but no articulation is available", not that the LLM ran
  with no input.

## MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Next to the priority badge, the page renders a row of MITRE ATT&CK
technique chips (e.g. `T1078`, `T1110.001`) that the LLM associated with
the event. Each chip shows the technique ID; hovering reveals the
official technique name as a tooltip (e.g. `T1078` → "Valid Accounts").
A chip whose ID is not in the currently vendored MITRE knowledge base
renders without a tooltip — the underlying analysis row was written
against an older MITRE bundle and the technique ID alone is shown as a
fallback. The chip row is omitted when the LLM returned no techniques.

## Metadata fields

Below the score fields the page shows the analysis metadata in a
two-column grid:

- **Language** — `KOREAN` or `ENGLISH`. Matches the language the analysis
  text was generated in.
- **Provider** — the LLM provider name (e.g. `openai`).
- **Model** — the model id requested (e.g. `gpt-4o`).
- **Model snapshot** — the provider-reported specific model version, if
  the upstream response carried one.
- **Prompt version** — the aimer prompt template version, if reported.
- **Requested by** — the account id that triggered the analysis, as
  stored on the analysis row.
- **Requested at** — ISO 8601 timestamp of the request.

## Analysis body

The body shows the LLM analysis text with PII tokens already restored
to their original values. The analysis is Markdown, and the page renders
it as formatted output — headings, bullet and numbered lists, and inline
code spans appear as styled elements rather than raw `#`, `-`, or
backtick characters. Raw HTML embedded in the text is never rendered as
live markup; it is treated as inert text, since the body is
LLM-generated.

Any `<<UNVERIFIED_IP_...>>` / `<<UNVERIFIED_EMAIL_...>>` /
`<<UNVERIFIED_MAC_...>>` markers — entities the LLM emitted that were
not present in the original event — are rendered as red pill badges so
they stand out from the rest of the analysis, even when they appear
inside a list item or heading.

## Retention banner

If the source `detection_events` row has been removed by retention but
the analysis row survives, the page shows a yellow banner reading
"Source event removed by retention; analysis result preserved." The
"Force re-run" button is hidden in this state because force re-run
requires the original event payload, which only aice-web-next holds.

## Force re-run

When the source event is still present, the page shows a "Force re-run
in aice-web-next" link. Clicking it opens aice-web-next at the original
event detail with a query parameter that tells aice-web-next to send
`force=true` on the next analyze click, bypassing the cached result.
